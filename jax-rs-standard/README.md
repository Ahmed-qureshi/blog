JEE and the myth of portability
-------------------------------

This sample application presents a small difference between two implementations of JAX-RS. If the JEE 
standard defines common behavior and implementations return results which are not the same, 
is the standard really reliable? [The blog post](http://dolszewski.com/java/jee-and-the-myth-of-portability/) describes the aforementioned problem.
